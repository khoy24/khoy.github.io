            <h3>Current</h3>
            <p >Hello again! I am a currently a junior at Iowa State University pursuing a computer science degree with a minor in data science.<br><br>

              I am co-president and founder of the Iowa State Girls Who Code College Loop, and am a member of the University Honors Program, Digital Women, Game Development Club, and Advanced Manufacturing Club. I also work as a peer mentor for the computer science department at Iowa State University.<br><br>
              
              I am currently very interested in anything UX/UI, software development, and consulting. But Iâ€™m always looking for any opportunities to learn!<br><br>
              
              This summer I worked at Travelers as an Engineering Development Program Intern and participated in a work prep program with Accenture, and the prior summer I worked as a TA for Girls Who Code.<br><br>
